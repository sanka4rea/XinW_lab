#### **CRC-SPA:** an accurate, robust, and efficient deep learning-based framework for tissue classification of histology slides and quantitative analysis of spatial organization features. Empowered by AI, CRC-SPA provides an automated solution for systematic profiling of tissue architecture in the tumor microenvironment.

#### Introduction

**The ecological diversity in the tumor microenvironment influences cancer progression and clinical outcomes of patients. However, the complexity of cellular and tissue components hamper quantitative dissection of the tumor microenvironment. We aimed to develop an efficient and robust artificial intelligence (AI)-empowered framework for the identification of prognostic spatial organization features based on histopathological images.**
